# Optimize Scraping Plan for Super Lawyers
## 0. Introduction
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to optimize the scraping of data from the Super Lawyers website. 
The current scraping process is slow and inefficient, and we aim to enhance it by implementing a more structured approach.
- crawl-listings: around 5 hours to complete 
- fetch-profile: around 45 minutes to complete 1510 profiles

## 1. Define Objectives
- Our goal is to reduce the overall scraping time by at least 50% while maintaining data accuracy and completeness.
